# **Data Preparation and Feature Selection for Machine Learning**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on **data cleaning, augmentation, merging, and feature selection** to create a structured dataset for machine learning. The goal is to improve data quality and ensure consistency before using it in predictive models.

## **Key Tasks**  

### **1. Data Cleaning and Augmentation**  
- Loaded the **customer transactions dataset**.  
- Handled **missing values** using mean, median, mode imputation, and predictive modeling.  
- Applied **synthetic data generation** techniques, including:  
  - Adding random noise to numerical values.  
  - Using **SMOTE** for data balancing.  
  - Applying log transformation for skewed data.  
- Saved the cleaned dataset as `customer_transactions_augmented.csv`.  

### **2. Merging Datasets**  
- Merged **customer transactions** with **social profile data**, linking them using an **ID mapping dataset**.  
- Standardized different customer ID formats to maintain consistency.  
- Handled cases where a single customer ID had multiple records.  
- Saved the merged dataset as `final_customer_data_[Databases-Peer-2].csv`.  

### **3. Feature Selection**  
- Created a **Customer Engagement Score** using transaction history and social media activity.  
- Engineered new features like:  
  - Moving averages of transactions.  
  - Time-based purchase aggregation.  
  - Text-based features using **TF-IDF**.  
- Identified **highly correlated features** using a **correlation heatmap**.  
- Selected the **top 10 most important features** using **SelectKBest**.  
- Saved the final dataset as `final_dataset_ready_[groupNumber].csv`.
